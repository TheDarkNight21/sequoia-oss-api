  "why_partnered": "In 2012, smartphones were fast supplanting cameras as the primary way to capture photos. But sharing photos was difficult—they took forever to upload and picture quality was only so-so. Kevin offered a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with friends. That combined with rapid user growth and engagement led us to believe Instagram had the potential to build a powerful social graph to rival those that already existed.",
