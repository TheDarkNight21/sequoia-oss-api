  "description": "Robco radically rethinks how products are made, using modular robot systems. From the phones in our pockets, to the rockets launching us to space, physical products are mainly made in a manual, strenuous, repetitive way — at industrial SMBs. Improving the industrial SMB status quo is arguably one of the most impactful global opportunities to ensure sustainability and long-term economic success. Robco does so with its innovative modular robotics platform for industrial use cases.",
