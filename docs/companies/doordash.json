  "why_partnered": "We sat next to Tony at a dinner one night and were amazed by how deeply he understood the logistical challenges of restaurant service. His methodical mindset, and grasp of complex, multi-sided marketplaces combined with a missionary zeal to serve local merchants convinced us that DoorDash was going to upend the last-mile logistics industry. Starting with the most complicated local businesses, restaurants in suburban America, highlighted the company’s determination and ability to carve out a marketing wedge in a highly competitive market.",
