  "why_partnered": "We believed there was an opportunity for an independent, mobile-focused upstart to challenge the status quo of SMS messaging on the back of rising smartphone adoption. Jan and Brian had built WhatsApp to be a clean, no-nonsense messaging platform. Loved by those who adopted it, we were astonished by how rapidly it scaled with no marketing spend. It was simple and it worked.",
