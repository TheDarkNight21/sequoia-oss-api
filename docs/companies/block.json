  "why_partnered": "Bootstrapped by Jack, Square (now Block) had a vision to allow anyone with an iPhone to become a merchant. Part hardware, part app, the mobile payments product was originally called Squirrel because of its resemblance to an acorn. A demo in which we saw Square in action (and in which we were charged $3.00) gave us a glimpse into the platform’s transformative power.",
