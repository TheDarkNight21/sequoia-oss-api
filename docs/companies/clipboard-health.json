  "description": "Clipboard Health is an app-based talent marketplace that matches healthcare professionals with open shifts at healthcare facilities near them. Its mission is to lift as many people up the socioeconomic ladder as possible. Short-staffed healthcare facilities represent a long-term problem that became more acute with COVID-19, leading to increased burnout among nurses, less care and access to healthcare for patients, and skyrocketing costs for healthcare facilities.",
