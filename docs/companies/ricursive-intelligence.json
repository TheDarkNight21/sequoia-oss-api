  "description": "Ricursive builds the AI stack that designs, verifies and closes silicon, so models and chips co-evolve in a tight loop. It enables a paradigm shift from fabless to “designless”: clients select the tradeoffs that matter to them, and Ricursive delivers a fully optimized, ready-to-build chip design. Models design next-gen chips that enable next-gen models, recursively accelerating our path to artificial superintelligence.",
