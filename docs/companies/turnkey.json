  "description": "Turnkey allows developers to generate and manage private keys across blockchains. With a simple API, builders can spin-up thousands of wallets, sign millions of transactions, and set permissions to ensure only allowed transactions are signed. Turnkey was built on a minimal, immutable, and deterministic operating system, designed for environments requiring paranoia and accountability putting builders in control of their keys while providing institutional-grade security.",
