  "description": "Arcwise is a platform for analytical but non-technical business users to build, publish, and maintain data and ML applications, all from their spreadsheet. They’re building a collaborative workspace to bridge the gap between business operators and technical data experts — ”arcing” the divide between notebooks and spreadsheets. Arcwise is the missing tool that would have saved years of person-hours at Flexport, where business-critical data applications repeatedly took months to move from spreadsheets to Python.",
