  "why_partnered": "The premise of Retool was simple, yet powerful. Internal tools were the largest category of software, and yet, despite innovation in nearly every other software sector, this was a space that had yet to benefit from a focus on design, user experience and the low-code movement. David Hsu deeply understood the pain engineers experienced building internal tools, and with Retool, set out to make it better. He helped us see what he saw: a future where millions of developers could be “liberated” to spend their time on their most fulfilling work.",
