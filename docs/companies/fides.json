  "description": "Fides is the first ever Management Governance Platform (MGP) enabling companies to globally monitor, execute and automate their corporate governance duties. On one hand, Fides acts as the single-source-of-truth for all things entity and makes it easy to find key info per entity in a structured, actionable and visualised way. On top, Fides streamlines the execution of workflows for governance-related decisions, particularly through meetings, resolutions and approvals among the c-level suite. Fides customers benefit from reducing director’s liabilities, lower spend on legal resources, accelerated deal-readiness in DD and M&A processes as well as preventing governance scandals.",
