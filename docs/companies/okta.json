  "why_partnered": "Todd and Frederic were early evangelists of user-centric technology. With Okta, they built an easy-to-use identity solution for the enterprise. We were struck with their technical depth and their customer obsession. That combined with an inevitable market shift to cloud-centric identity and mobile adoption, gave us conviction that Okta would become the market leader in identity and access management.",
