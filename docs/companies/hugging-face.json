  "description": "Hugging Face is a community-based repository for open-source ML technology. It is a platform that stores, serves, and manages the latest and greatest in open-source ML models, including enabling customers to fine-tune these models and deploy them at scale. Hugging Face’s secret sauce is its community: it has become a go-to destination for companies and researchers in the world of ML to collaborate. In this respect, it can be loosely analogized to GitHub, but for ML rather than traditional software engineering.",
